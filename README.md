Hello, I'm Kevin McPeak

..I am an technology enthusist with over 10 years of professional experience working with clients to help implement their software solutions.

..However, I have gained a deep passion for software development over the last few years!

..I believe my unique set of skills sets me apart from others in the industry.

..Currently, I am working on MERN stack projects like creating a social meeting clone.  After, I plan to enhance my Workout Generator project by connecting it Mongo DB with user authentication.
